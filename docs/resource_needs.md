<h1>Resource Needs and Requirements</h1>

<a href="https://JoshFerkins.github.io/EIT-ac-nz-ITPM5240-202051MB-c-b-torture-Website/home.html">Home</a>

<h2>Financial Resources</h2>

<p>The software it's self has a very clear estimation of the project cost, this cost comes to a total of $50,000. This is relatively small to the large majority of high-spec projects and software but we are confident that this budget will be able to support our needs and fulfill our requirements.</p>

<p>Little monitary requirments will be needed outside of this original budget, the smaller investments will be personal from the team towards personal items such as food, and personal necessities.</p>

<h2>Education Resources</h2>

<p>The only education the will be required is further education in the subject that we are currently studying, this will be done in and out of class time. Most learning will be completed in our own personal time and will be completely optional but definitely encouraged. Withfurther education in this field we will be able to further push the limits of our project and more effectively do so. Education is crucial but there is little we can do to enforce learning on the project group.</p>

<h2>Physical Resources</h2>

<p>Access to GitHub Pages is required. This will be supplied by EIT with a free and accessible account and repository. Although an additional repository created under our personal accounts is required to creat the website for the original GitHub gifted does not have GitHub Pages activated.</p>

<p>Access to computers will be a definite requirement and need. Without computers we will not be able to procced with the creation of the project.</p>

<p>Items such as paper will be needed, this will be needed for making diagrams such as paper prototypes. This is a definite requirement because paper prototypes aid in quickly and effectiently completing and planning the project.</p>


<h2>Emotional Resources</h2>

<p>A crying corner has been requested by multiple of our staff, this has been implemented and allowed although crying is reduced down to a maximum of ten minutes</p>
