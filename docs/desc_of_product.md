<p> Cucumber and Banana Musice is an mp3 player that is both compatible with computer and mobile devices. It offers an exquisite experience and service for the cost of nothing. The main difference between our mp3 player and others such as spotify or Groove Music is that it offers a free and easily acessable mp3 conversion software. All that is required is an mp4 file, or a url linking to an mp3/4 and ofc that you are registered with C & B Music.</p>

<p>The sign up to our software is simply. Simply login or download the application, hit register now, enter credentials and your ready to go. All song information and data is stored via the cloud, therefore you will never need to re-download previously downloaded and installed songs and playlists. All songs that are on your account are able to be downloaded and accessed via the device free of charge. There is only one charge that aids in increasing your user experience. This optional charge is of $1.49 USD every month. This of course is on optional fee. the ad/per song ratio on C & B Music is far lower than any of our competiors. Major players such as Spotify have their ad/per song at around 0.5 meaning they play one add every two songs, ours is only a mere 0.2. These donations will be going solely to worker funds as well as improving the service that we offer to our users. The only profit we are gaining from this is the ad revenue as well as donations. All revenue wil be placed towards funds and advancements in the software.</p>
  
<p>Josh Ferkins has been assigned the position as Project Manager as part of his role he is in charge of ensuring all planning, creation and implemenation of this project goes smoothely and that all dead lines are met. Josh is one of two members in this project, Gregor Tutty is the second and he has been allocated Head Developer. His tasks mainly includ creating stylish designs and ingenious ideas for the software that will be implemented into our project. All wireframes are created by Gregor with the charts being created by Josh. Josh is usually incharge of the coding aspect of the project with Gregor being more of the designer and artist. Both of these two skilled designer and developers have the neccesary skills to perform well and meet the deadlines, but they cannot work without each other therefore they are the perfect colaboration for this project.<;p>


<h2>Competing Product Analysis</h2>

<h3>Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify is a web and app music player that allows for audio and video files to be uploaded and monetised by creators worldwide. The application is totally free with ads and gives you the option to purchase a premium to avoid ads. This business model has worked the best out of all music player applications as it has garnered the greatest notoriety and profits. Spotify is also the greatest holder of copyrighted material where they exhibit over 70 million songs. This is possibly their greatest strength and is compounded by a fantastic and easy to use interface. It would make sense to take most inspiration from what Spotify has tried and tested to be true.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spotify was founded in 2006 in Stockholm Sweden</li>
  <li>70 million songs + 60,000 new songs daily</li>
  <li>Premium Model</li>
  <li>Web App, App, and Mobile.</li>
  <li>345 million users</li>
  <li>155 million subscribers ($10 USD / mo)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main feature of the application; the music player, is always on display at the bottom of the application where it’s subfeatures can be accessed at all times, this would be the most vital note to take away from Spotify's theme but it's also important to point out the dark theme, grid layout, and modern aesthetic. These all help make Spotify seem very professional and is practically an industry standard for other music players too. It’s also cool to see the utilisation of symbols for each interaction which helps memorise critical paths for the user, and also helps the less abled users discern each button's use. The overall UX UI of Spotify is extremely well made and intuitive.</p>
  
<h3>Apple Music</h3>

<p>Apple Music is a subsidiary of Apple that lets people move their downloaded iOS songs to a cloud service. Apple music exhibits a slightly larger range of music than Spotify, however that likely won't last as Spotify has been adding much more content than apple music. Apple does utilise exclusivity deals to make their music platform unique.</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/apple_analy.png" width="800" height="500"/>
</div>

<p>Apple keeps their music player at the top of the screen and keeps two different fields, one bar on the left for selecting different pages and the main bar which shows whichever tab you’ve entered, i.e. playlists or discovery. This is a pretty standard layout although I believe a music player on the top of the screen is an odd choice, typically it’s standard to keep important buttons or a search bar at the top. I found it intriguing that although apple music is uniquel with it’s layout the most important features are similar to spotify, I believe there are industry standards that shouldn’t be deviated from, and apple showcases this with their similarity to spotify and vice versa.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple music was debuted by Apple San Francisco in 2015.</li>
  <li>75 million songs + 40,000 new songs daily</li>
  <li>Pay to use model</li>
  <li>Web App, App, and Mobile (iOS, IpadOS MacOS, etc.)</li>
  <li>72 million users ($10 USD / mo)
</ul>

<h3>Youtube Music</h3>

<p>YT Music is a streaming service provided by Youtube, a subsidiary of Google. This service particularly caters towards streaming music by popular artists as well as music commonly found on youtube, a platform which was already popular for finding music. This platform allows users to move their music from youtube to a more music catered application. With additional features that can cater to the specific user base that youtube’s video streaming site doesn't allow for such as shuffling playlists and finding new music.</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/youtube_music_analy.png" width="800" height="500"/>
</div>

<p>Youtube Music’s UI is much more similar to the original youtube streaming service in terms of layout and less similar to music applications such as spotify or apple. It’s main deviation from the norm would be it’s avoidance of side bars, it only shows the main screen and a player at the bottom with 4 options at the top. This is a lot cleaner and less cluttered but increases the number of actions required to get to your playlists and other important features. Spotify manages to keep most important features on one screen without cluttering or confusing the application. YT Music does seem much simpler which is good in some instances, although I do like the aesthetic I think it misses out on the features that apple music and spotify have perfected.</p>

<ul>
  <li>YT Music was debuted on November 12, 2015 by Google</li>
  <li>60 million songs</li>
  <li>Freemium Model</li>
  <li>Web app, mobile.</li>
  <li>30 million subscribers ($10 USD / mo)</li>
</ul>
