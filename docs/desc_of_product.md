<p> Cucumber and Banana Musice is an mp3 player that is both compatible with computer and mobile devices. It offers an exquisite experience and service for the cost of nothing. The main difference between our mp3 player and others such as spotify or Groove Music is that it offers a free and easily acessable mp3 conversion software. All that is required is an mp4 file, or a url linking to an mp3/4 and ofc that you are registered with C & B Music.</p>

<p>The sign up to our software is simply. Simply login or download the application, hit register now, enter credentials and your ready to go. All song information and data is stored via the cloud, therefore you will never need to re-download previously downloaded and installed songs and playlists. All songs that are on your account are able to be downloaded and accessed via the device free of charge. There is only one charge that aids in increasing your user experience. This optional charge is of $1.49 USD every month
