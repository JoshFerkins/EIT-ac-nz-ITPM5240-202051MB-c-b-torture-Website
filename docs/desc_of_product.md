<p> Cucumber and Banana Musice is an mp3 player that is both compatible with computer and mobile devices. It offers an exquisite experience and service for the cost of nothing. The main difference between our mp3 player and others such as spotify or Groove Music is that it offers a free and easily acessable mp3 conversion software. All that is required is an mp4 file, or a url linking to an mp3/4 and ofc that you are registered with C & B Music.</p>

<p>The sign up to our software is simply. Simply login or download the application, hit register now, enter credentials and your ready to go. All song information and data is stored via the cloud, therefore you will never need to re-download previously downloaded and installed songs and playlists. All songs that are on your account are able to be downloaded and accessed via the device free of charge. There is only one charge that aids in increasing your user experience. This optional charge is of $1.49 USD every month. This of course is on optional fee. the ad/per song ratio on C & B Music is far lower than any of our competiors. Major players such as Spotify have their ad/per song at around 0.5 meaning they play one add every two songs, ours is only a mere 0.2. These donations will be going solely to worker funds as well as improving the service that we offer to our users. The only profit we are gaining from this is the ad revenue as well as donations. All revenue wil be placed towards funds and advancements in the software.</p>
  
<p>Josh Ferkins has been assigned the position as Project Manager as part of his role he is in charge of ensuring all planning, creation and implemenation of this project goes smoothely and that all dead lines are met. Josh is one of two members in this project, Gregor Tutty is the second and he has been allocated Head Developer.
