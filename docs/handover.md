<h1>Deployment Documentation</h1>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<h4>Preperation</h4>
<p>For the preparation stage we will gather all the code required to make the application function such as executables, libraries, configs, and resources. These will be packaged as the single software release that can be downloaded as an application. The website will require a server setup and domain name. A host server must be verified and correctly set up.<p>
<br>
  
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>Before an update can be implemented to a live environment, it should be put in a local test server where it can be stress tested and configured. Any immediate bugs can be fixed before being moved to a live environment.</p>
<br>

<h4>Deployment</h4>
<p>Once the alpha release has been tested it can be moved to the live servers. Once this has happened it is important to stay alert with what customers are saying and to be hyper vigilant about any potential bugs and broken features that could ruin user experience. Hot fixes can be implemented to fix any less obvious bugs that have sneaked into this release.</p>

<h3>Deployment Goals</h3>
<p>This deployment of our application will be the alpha release of our application C&B Music. This release must be time and cost efficient and will help further development of the application and keep the application up to date. This alpha release stage will focus on user feedback and is mostly testing and making assessments with a small portion of users.</p>

<p>Our goals for this deployment are as follows:
  
<ul>
  <li>A working website</li>
  <li>Establish communication with the customer</li>
  <li>Ensure the mobile website and application are optimally released</li>
  <li>Gather user feedback</li>
  <li>Record user data for the alpha release</li>
  <li>Evaluating customer feedback</li>
  <li>Eliminating bugs</li>
  <li>Optimised user experience</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Risk management will be a major focus for the application's release. In order to mitigate risks we will need to ensure all following likelihoods and consequences are properly assessed and managed. We will measure the importance of a risk according to the level of probability and Severity for each risk. These will have 3 levels, Critical, Moderate, and Low Severity. Each level is coloured red, yellow, and green respectively.</p>
